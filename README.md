## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

The entire process was quite challenging, and there were little errors in my code that made the project very tedious to work on. The main challenge was getting the right pieces together, for example, on some parts, I wasn't sure if I should reference "GAMES_JSON" or games, however once I got that figured out it wasn't too hard to complete the objectives of the challenge - it simply just required a lot of tinkering around.
